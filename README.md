# QbTrackerUpdater
This script allows you to replace a given tracker on current torrents. It was made for qbittorent V4.1.9.1 on windows and will need to be adapted for another torrent client and / or operating system.
It uses the bencode.py module to decode and encode the fastresume files. The release was made with pyinstaller.
